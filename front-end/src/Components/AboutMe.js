        <p>
          Self taught and HIGHLY motivated, full stack JavaScript developer
          looking for a career change. Growing up in the oil industry I have
          learned the value of hard work and determination. I started learning
          in October 2020 with "Python for everybody" on Coursera.This is where I
          learned the fundamentals of programming. After that I started learning
          HTML and CSS and eventually found Team Treehouse and started the Full
          Stack JavaScript Tech Degree where I learned React, Node and Express,
          API's and so much more.I Finished the Tech Degree in February 2022.
          My 10 projects from this degree can be found on my GitHub account at:
          https://github.com/ccarver80 With the very last project being a full
          stack web application found here:
          https://github.com/ccarver80/React-REST-FS-API
